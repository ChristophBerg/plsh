PL/sh Installation Instructions
===============================

You need to have PostgreSQL 7.3 or later, and you need to have the
server include files available, either installed or in the PostgreSQL
source tree.

To build and install PL/sh, use this procedure: 

./configure --prefix=YOUR_CHOICE CPPFLAGS=-I/where/ever/pgsql/src/include
make
make install

To declare the language in a database, use 

psql -d DBNAME -f PREFIX/share/pgplsh/createlang_pgplsh.sql

with a server running.  To drop it, use 'droplang plsh', or DROP
FUNCTION plsh_handler(); DROP LANGUAGE plsh; if you want to do it
manually.
