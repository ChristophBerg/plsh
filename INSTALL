PL/sh Installation Instructions
===============================

You need to have PostgreSQL 8.0 or later, and you need to have the
server include files installed.

To build and install PL/sh, use this procedure:

make
make install

To run the test suite:

make installcheck

The include files are found using the pg_config program that is
included in the PostgreSQL installation.  To use a different
PostgreSQL installation, point configure to a different pg_config like
so:

make PG_CONFIG=/else/where/pg_config
make install PG_CONFIG=/else/where/pg_config

Note that generally server-side modules such as this one have to be
recompiled for every major PostgreSQL version (that is, 8.4, 9.0,
...).

To declare the language in a database, use the extension system with
PostgreSQL version 9.1 or later.  Run

CREATE EXTENSION plsh;

inside the database of choice.  To upgrade from a previous
installation that doesn't use the extension system, use

CREATE EXTENSION plsh FROM unpackaged;

Use DROP EXTENSION to remove it.

With versions prior to PostgreSQL 9.1, use

psql -d DBNAME -f .../share/contrib/plsh.sql

with a server running.  To drop it, use "droplang plsh", or DROP
FUNCTION plsh_handler(); DROP LANGUAGE plsh; if you want to do it
manually.
